# @learnpayload/payload-cli

‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPERIMENTAL**: This tool is currently in experimental stage. Use at your own risk in production environments.

This CLI tool is maintained by [LearnPayload](https://youtube.com/@learnpayload), where we create educational content about Payload CMS development. Watch our channel for tutorials on using this CLI tool, database migrations, and other Payload CMS development best practices.

## Requirements

- [Bun Runtime](https://bun.sh) - This tool is specifically built to run with Bun
- Payload CMS project

## Installation

Install globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @learnpayload/payload-cli
```

## Overview

This CLI tool provides database management commands for Payload CMS projects, similar to tools like Laravel's Artisan. It helps manage database migrations, seeding, and other database-related tasks.

## Available Commands

- `payload migrate` - Run pending migrations
- `payload migrate:create` - Create a new migration file
- `payload migrate:down` - Rollback the last batch of migrations
- `payload migrate:refresh` - Rollback and re-run all migrations
- `payload migrate:reset` - Rollback all migrations
- `payload migrate:status` - Check migration status
- `payload migrate:fresh` - Drop all entities and re-run migrations
- `payload db:seed` - Run database seeders

## Usage

After installation, you can run commands from any Payload project directory:

```bash
# Check migration status
payload migrate:status

# Create a new migration
payload migrate:create

# Run pending migrations
payload migrate
```

## Database Seeding

The `db:seed` command runs your database seeder file. Create a seeder file at:

```
src/db/seed.ts
```

Example seeder file:

```typescript
export const handler = async () => {
  // Your seeding logic here
  await createUsers();
  await createInitialContent();
};
```

Run the seeder with:

```bash
payload db:seed
```

## Project Structure

The tool expects your Payload configuration to be located at:

```
src/payload.config.ts
```

Migration and seeder files should be placed in the appropriate directories within your project (documentation coming soon).

## Roadmap

Taking inspiration from Laravel's Artisan CLI, we plan to expand this tool's capabilities:

### Command Generation

- [ ] `make:command` - Generate custom CLI commands
- [ ] Command scaffolding with built-in argument and option parsing
- [ ] Custom command namespacing support

### Payload Component Generation

- [ ] `make:collection` - Generate collection configurations
- [ ] `make:global` - Generate global configurations
- [ ] `make:component` - Scaffold custom React components with Payload integration
- [ ] Built-in component templates and best practices

### Plugin Development

- [ ] `make:plugin` - Generate plugin boilerplate
- [ ] Plugin development tools and utilities
- [ ] Plugin testing helpers

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Interactive command generation wizard
- [ ] Custom component template support
- [ ] Plugin marketplace integration
- [ ] Development environment tooling
